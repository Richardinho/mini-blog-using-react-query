# Mini Blog

This is a demo using NextJS, React, and React Query. The purpose for me was to experiment using these
technologies together, particularly React Query, which I hadn't previously used.

It is based on a similar demo created by Tanner Linsley https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query-blog-refactor-example

## Instructions 

Install node modules and run development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
